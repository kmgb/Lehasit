Team Fortress 2 injection-based dodgeball bot ...I mean, beep boop

Original name: לְהָסִיט

A bot that reflects rockets pretty well.
Much of the source code derives from one of my older works called Keter. The coding style is inconsistent as Keter's updates have spanned multiple years apart and has some code copied verbatim from the Source SDK 2013 of which Team Fortress 2 is based.
